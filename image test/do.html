<h1>Google Chrome</h1>
<p>Google Chrome is a cross-platform web browser developed by Google. It was first released in 2008 for Microsoft Windows, and was later ported to Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android. The browser is also the main component of Chrome OS, where it serves as the platform for web apps.

Most of Chrome's source code comes from the Google's free and open-source software project Chromium, but <span style="border:3px solid black">Chrome</span> is licensed as proprietary freeware.[8] WebKit was the original rendering engine, but Google eventually forked it to create the Blink engine; all Chrome variants except iOS now use Blink.[9]

As of May 2020, StatCounter and NetMarketShare estimates that Chrome has a 68% worldwide browser market share (after peaking at 72.38% in November 2018) on personal computers (PC),[10][11] 63.58% and 65.01% respectively across all platforms.[12][13] Because of this success, Google has expanded the "Chrome" brand name to other products: Chrome OS, Chromecast, Chromebook, Chromebit, Chromebox, and Chromebase.
